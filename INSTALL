Installation Notes for PyADF
============================

There are to ways of installing PyADF:
a) by using the SVN version locally (for developers)
b) as a package using setup.py (for users)


In both cases, you have to make sure the required
packages are installed and working on your system.
This are:

- Python >= 2.4
  (on most machines this is preinstalled)

- pyKF (by Drew McCormack)
  (this is preinstalled on the TC cluster)

- a working installation of ADF
  (in particular, ADFHOME and friends have to be defined)
  PyADF requires a recent trunk version of ADF (Feb 2007 or newer)

- openbabel, including Python wrapper
  On the TC cluster, include this in your .bashrc (or whatever shell you are using) :
     
     export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/home4/cjacob/share/modules
     module load openbabel

- for generating documentation, epydoc v2.1 is needed
  On the TC cluster, include this in your .bashrc (or whatever shell you are using) :
     
     export MODULEPATH=$MODULEPATH:/home4/cjacob/share/modules
     module load epydoc


a) use the SVN version
----------------------

1. check out pyadf from SVN:

   svn co svn+ssh://user@radon.chem.vu.nl/users/svn/repositories/seamless/trunk pyadf

2. set the following environment variables in your .bashrc

   export PYADFHOME=((path-to-pyadf))

   export PATH=$PATH:((path-to-pyadf))/src/scripts
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:((path-to-pyadf))/src

   (if you want to use a module for this, on the TC cluster have a look at
    /home4/cjacob/share/modules/pyadf)

3. That should be it - your are ready to enjoy PyADF.

   On the TC cluster, you can submit PyADF input files to the 
   queueing system using the option "-a pyadf"


b) as a package using setup.py
------------------------------

This is not completly working yet
